<p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><strong>(a) Binding Arbitration</strong></font></p>
<p class="western"><br /><br /></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">If You and OETS cannot resolve a debt, liability, suit, right, demand, obligation, promise, act, contract, cost, expense, damage, legal claim, complaint, action, or cause of action of any nature, character, and description (&ldquo;Claim&rdquo;) through out-of-court, informal negotiations, either party may elect to have the Claim finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s). YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT WITH A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party. </font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted in the State of California under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), as modified by this Agreement, available at the AAA website www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Except as otherwise provided for herein, OETS will pay the AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedures 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, You hereby agree to reimburse OETS for all payments disbursed that are Your obligation to reimburse under the AAA Rules. If You are unable to pay the arbitration fee, OETS will pay it directly upon receiving a written request and a sworn statement that you are unable to pay. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to resolve, except that issues relating to the enforceability of the arbitration provision, which are for a Court of Competent Jurisdiction to resolve. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through document submission, through telephone, or online. The arbitrator will issue a decision in writing, but need only provide a statement of reasons if requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. OETS may litigate to compel arbitration in court, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to modify, confirm, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. </font></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><strong>(b) Restrictions Against Joinder of Claims</strong></font></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">You and OETS agree that any arbitration shall be limited to each Claim individually. YOU AND OETS HEREBY AGREE THAT EACH MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN YOUR OR OETS&rsquo;S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. In the event that this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in a court of competent jurisdiction, the Claim will still be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration upon the election of either party, and any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s).&nbsp; In addition: (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other arbitration, and (2) there is no right for any Claim to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to employ class action procedures, and (3) there is no right of authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf either of the general public or any other individuals. </font></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><strong>(c) Remedies in Aid of Arbitration; Equitable Relief</strong></font></p>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude You or OETS from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including, without limitation, orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration or confirm an arbitral award, from a Court of Competent Jurisdiction.&nbsp; Furthermore, this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude You or OETS from applying to a Court of Competent Jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary. As used herein, &ldquo;</font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><strong>Court of Competent Jurisdiction&rdquo;</strong></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"> means any federal or state court: (1) that has jurisdiction over the subject matter; and (2) that is located in the county of San Francisco, California. </font></p>

The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party. THE PROPER VENUE FOR ANY JUDICIAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN OR NEAREST TO SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. THE PARTIES HEREBY STIPULATE TO, AND AGREE TO WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO, THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF SUCH COURTS, AND FURTHER EXPRESSLY SUBMIT TO EXTRATERRITORIAL SERVICE OF PROCESS. THE PARTIES HEREBY FURTHER AGREE TO ACCEPT SERVICE OF PROCESS BY EMAIL AND FIRST CLASS MAIL AT THE LAST KNOWN EMAIL AND MAILING ADDRESSES PROVIDED BY THE PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><strong>24. GENERAL </strong></font></p>
<p class="western"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between OETS and You concerning Your use of the App. This Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of OETS or by the unilateral amendment of this Agreement by OETS and by the posting by OETS of such amended version. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. This Agreement and all of Your rights and obligations hereunder will not be assignable or transferable by You without the prior written consent of OETS. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns. You and OETS are independent contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. Except for the OETS Parties and the Indemnified Parties as and to the extent set forth in Sections 8, 15, 17(a), 19, and 21(e), and in this paragraph, and OETS&rsquo;s licensors and suppliers as to the extent expressly stated in this Agreement, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement or infringement of proprietary or other third-party rights by You would cause irreparable injury to OETS and OETS&rsquo;s licensors and suppliers, and would therefore entitle OETS or OETS&rsquo;s licensors or suppliers, as the case may be, to injunctive relief. The headings in this Agreement are for the purpose of convenience only and shall not limit, enlarge, or affect any of the covenants, terms, conditions or provisions of this Agreement.</font></p>
