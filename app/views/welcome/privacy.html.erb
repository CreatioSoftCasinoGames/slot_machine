<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif"><strong>1. CHILDREN&rsquo;S PRIVACY</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif">OETS does not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18. If OETS obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 18, OETS will immediately delete such information from its database. Because OETS does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 18, OETS has no such information to use or disclose to third parties. OETS has designed this Privacy Policy in order to comply with the Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (&ldquo;</font><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif"><strong>COPPA</strong></font><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif">&rdquo;). </font><font face="MS Mincho, serif">  </font></p>

<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif"><strong>(a) Traffic Data.</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif">Like most website and mobile application operators, OETS automatically gathers information of the sort that browsers automatically make available, including: (i) IP addresses; (ii) domain servers; (iii) types of computers accessing the App; and (iv) types of Web browsers accessing the App (collectively &ldquo;</font><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif"><strong>Traffic Data</strong></font><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif">&rdquo;). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify You. </font><font face="MS Mincho, serif">  </font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif"><strong>(b)</strong></font> <font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif"><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></font></p>
<p>&ldquo;<font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif"><strong>Cookies</strong></font><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif">&rdquo; are text files that are placed on your computer or other electronic device (collectively for ease of reference, a &ldquo;computer&rdquo;) by websites and mobile applications that you visit, download, or use or certain emails that you open. A Cookie acts as a string of information that a website or mobile application stores on a user&rsquo;s computer or mobile device, and that the user&rsquo;s browser provides to the App each time the user submits a query. The purpose of a Cookie is to identify the user as a unique user of the App. </font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif">OETS uses two types of Cookies &ndash; &ldquo;first-party cookies&rdquo; and &ldquo;third-party cookies.&rdquo; </font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif"><strong>First Party Cookies</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif">OETS uses first-party cookies on the App, for example the Google Analytics Cookie, for the following purposes: </font></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif">to gather visitor and access information relevant to customizing your experience on the App to your interests; and </font></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif">to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the App. </font></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif">In addition to these purposes, Google, Inc. (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;) uses third-party cookies to serve online interest-based advertisements on the OETS. As an important example, Google uses of a cookie known as &ldquo;DoubleClick&rdquo; to enable both Google and Google&rsquo;s third party marketing partners to serve advertisements to You based on information gathered during Your use of the App or Your visit to other websites or download and/or use of other mobile applications and services (collectively, &ldquo;Third Party App&rdquo;).</font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRomanPSMT, serif">OETS may advertise on Third Party App to You after You access the App. OETS and its third party marketing partners, including without limitation Google, may use first party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) to inform, optimize, and serve advertisements to You based on Your use of the App or Your use of Third Party App, specifically for the following reasons: </font></p>
<ul>
